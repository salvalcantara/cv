:   I join Talaia (later [Auvik](https://www.auvik.com/media-room/press-releases/auvik-acquires-network-traffic-analytics-company-talaia/)) to help migrate from a coupled monolith to a (micro-)service/distributed architecture. Overall, I work on different fronts, playing a traversal role within the company, where I am a shareholder since late 2017.\

    Frontend:

    - Add new features using Python/Django and Javascript (jQuery, D3, React)
    - Conversion into multi-tenant SaaS
    - Integration with IdPs (login via SAML/SSO)
    - REST APIs (Django REST Framework)

    Backend:

    - Add new features and fix bugs in the exising —legacy— NetFlow core processor written in C
    - Minor excursions into Go for network-related tasks (e.g., replicate a NetFlow stream)
    - Create small DSLs using ANTLR4
    - Develop the app classification module within the new (distributed) NetFlow processing engine using Scala/Apache Flink and Machine Learning techniques
    - Getting familiar with specialized data structures and algorithms (Bloom Filters, Count Min Sketches, Decision Trees, Frequent Itemset Mining, Stream Processing)

    DevOps/Others:

    - Ansible, Fabric, Vagrant, Docker, GCP (Kubernetes), Gitlab CI, Fluentd, Collectd, Grafana
    - Ocassionally, conduct onpremise installations and provide support/training to our customers
    - Write and review deliverables for different projects (project funding

    - Study and evaluation of different control strategies (Fuzzy control, PID control + decoupling) 
    - PLCs/SCADA programming for the control of industrial biotrickling filters (PLC used: TBOX MS32 from CSE Semaphore)
    - Design and implementation of a web-based monitoring platform for the company's PLCs data. Technologies used:
        + VB.NET, MODBUS/TCP
